## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## i successfully developed this game by following these steps

-   "Udacity" provided github link <https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game> in rubic structure and I downloaded the skeleton project  regarding to this game.
-   I downloaded the zip file and extracted all files from it .
-   I choose ATOM application and modified the skeleton project to  achieve the game as per Instructions.
-   while modifying I came to know that, mostly the modifications are done in `app.js`.
-   at initial in class `girl` I created a player to play game and fixed its position at the center of canvas.
-   By using (x , y) elements I limited the player moving area. when the player moves to edge then it stops and will not cross it.
-   created three bugs and they moves randomly one after another with different speeds.
-   I created three extra players, so that the person playing that game can choose the player.
-   I created `runs` score in the game.so that when ever the player the `water-block.png` then the score increases.
-   By using `prototype` i `updated` and `rendered` the player.
-   By using `prototype` i `updated` and `rendered` the enemy.
